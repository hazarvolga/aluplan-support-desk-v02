# Session Summary - 2026-05-13

## Goal
Stabilize the backend startup path, harden a few real code risks, reduce repo-root noise, and clean up frontend AI settings debt without trusting stale root markdown reports.

## What Was Done

### Faz 0 - Checkpoint
- Commit: `137309c chore: checkpoint pending product code changes`
- Preserved existing uncommitted product work before starting focused cleanup.

### Faz 1 - Backend startup blocker
- Root cause reproduced: `nest build` failed with `EMFILE: too many open files, watch`
- Fix: disabled asset watchers in `apps/backend/nest-cli.json`
- Commit: `10a5d1e fix(backend): disable asset watchers during build`
- Verification:
  - Backend build: passed
  - Backend startup: passed
  - App booted successfully on `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`

### Faz 2 - Security / ops hardening
- Locked down `POST /products/internal/restore-faqs` behind `JwtAuthGuard + RbacGuard + Roles('admin')`
- Tightened WebSocket CORS origin handling to configured origins only
- Reduced handshake diagnostics so token prefixes are no longer logged
- Commit: `6aebabe fix(backend): harden restore endpoint and ws origins`

### Faz 3 - Repo hygiene / archival cleanup
- Moved misleading root-level legacy reports and artifacts into:
  - `archive/legacy-root-docs/2026-05-13/`
  - `archive/legacy-artifacts/2026-05-13/`
- Added a short archive README to mark them as historical only
- Ignored local worktree / graphify scratch artifacts in `.gitignore`
- Commit: `6e3f81f chore(repo): archive legacy root reports`

### Faz 4 - Frontend stabilization
- Fixed `useAiHealthSocket()` listener duplication on reconnect by binding handlers once per hook lifecycle
- Replaced hardcoded AI settings strings with `next-intl` keys
- Added new translation keys to `tr.json`, `en.json`, and `de.json`
- Commit: `0f44840 fix(frontend): stabilize ai settings socket and i18n`

### Faz 5 - Verification / test reliability
- Backend typecheck: passed
- Backend build: passed
- Frontend typecheck: passed
- Targeted backend Jest run passed:
  - `src/notifications/notifications.gateway.spec.ts`
- Important note:
  - Earlier “SWC native binding” suspicion was not reproduced in the current shell path
  - The bigger issue here was flaky command streaming in this environment; `spawnSync` produced reliable verification output

## Current Clean State
- New commits in order:
  1. `10a5d1e fix(backend): disable asset watchers during build`
  2. `6aebabe fix(backend): harden restore endpoint and ws origins`
  3. `6e3f81f chore(repo): archive legacy root reports`
  4. `0f44840 fix(frontend): stabilize ai settings socket and i18n`

## Remaining Local Noise Not Touched
- Modified:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `CLAUDE.md`
  - `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
- Untracked:
  - `.agents/skills/`
  - `.github/agents/`
  - `.kiro/specs/ai-pipeline-data-cleanup/`
  - `.kiro/specs/crm-realtime-sync/`
  - `.kiro/specs/rich-text-editor/`
  - `.kiro/specs/ui-contrast-accessibility/`

These were left alone deliberately because they look like user/workflow artifacts rather than product-code fixes.

## Blockers / Follow-up
- `graphify` CLI was not available in PATH during this session, so the requested post-phase graph refresh could not be executed here
- If phase-by-phase graph updates are mandatory, install or expose `graphify` in PATH and run:
  - `graphify update .`
- Good next targets:
  1. broader backend Jest sweep
  2. frontend AI settings interaction smoke test
  3. remaining direct `process.env` cleanup in backend

## Follow-up - 2026-05-13 Ticket Diagnosis Stabilization

### What changed
- Frontend ticket creation is now explicitly **AI-optional**:
  - users can continue directly to ticket creation without waiting for diagnosis
  - `my-tickets` now shows a retryable degraded state when backend fetch fails
  - API network failures are classified as `BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE` instead of leaking raw `Failed to fetch`
- Backend diagnosis now surfaces whether the answer came from:
  - `LLM`
  - `FALLBACK` (top grounded content used after bounded generation timeout / empty response)

### Commits
- `91777bb fix(frontend): make ai diagnosis optional for ticket creation`
- `8e61383 fix(ai): surface bounded diagnosis fallback mode`

### Verification
- Frontend:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` passed in `apps/frontend`
  - `./node_modules/.bin/vitest run src/lib/api.spec.ts` passed
- Backend:
  - `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend typecheck` passed
  - `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend test -- ai-query.service.spec.ts` passed

### Important notes
- `graphify update .` was attempted after each phase but the `graphify` binary is still unavailable in PATH in this shell.
- `gitnexus detect_changes` reports HIGH risk because the repository already contains unrelated modified files from prior RAG/indexing work; phase commits were staged narrowly to avoid pulling unrelated changes into the new commits.

## Follow-up - 2026-05-13 Sync Diagnosis Spinner

### Root cause
- A customer `POST /api/v1/ai/query?wait=true` reached backend and retrieval finished quickly.
- The request then hung in LLM re-ranking because Gemini free-tier returned `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` for `gemini-2.5-flash`, including retry delays up to ~59s.
- The existing 25s diagnosis fallback guarded the final answer generation, but not the earlier LLM re-ranking step.

### Fix applied
- Propagated the resolved `wait` flag from `AiQueryService.query()` into `queryInternal()`.
- For synchronous `wait=true` diagnosis calls, skipped LLM re-ranking and kept deterministic retrieval + heuristic re-ranking.
- Added a regression test proving synchronous wait queries do not call `ai.generate()` for re-ranking.

### Verification
- `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend test -- ai-query.service.spec.ts` passed
- `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend typecheck` passed
- `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend build` passed
- Backend restarted successfully on `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`

## Memory System Note - 2026-05-13

The `.ai` folder now acts as the project memory system:

- `.ai/bootstrap.txt`: startup protocol and truth hierarchy for agents.
- `.ai/current-focus.md`: active work, known risks, and next recommended step.
- `.ai/session-summary.md`: chronological session history, commits, verification, and follow-up notes.
- `.ai/architecture-decisions.md`: durable architecture decisions in short ADR form.
- `.ai/summaries/condensed.md`: five-minute handoff summary for new agents.
- `.ai/retrieval.yaml`: retrieval priority and memory source policy.

Maintenance rule:

- Update `session-summary.md` after meaningful implementation or debugging work.
- Update `current-focus.md` when the next active objective changes.
- Add or revise an ADR when a technical direction should persist across sessions.
- Refresh `summaries/condensed.md` after major phase changes or stabilization milestones.
- Prefer code, tests, Git history, GitNexus, Graphify, and `.ai` memory over stale root-level Markdown.

## Follow-up - 2026-05-13 Regression Guard Stabilization

### Root cause
- Backend regression guard failed because `AuthController` now depends on `ConfigService`, while `auth.controller.spec.ts` still only provided `AuthService`.
- Frontend targeted test command was initially invoked through the package script with an extra `--`, causing Vitest to run a wider suite than intended.
- The wider frontend run exposed two independent test harness issues:
  - `DocBreadcrumb.spec.tsx` expected the Turkish label `Yardım`, but its `next-intl` mock returned raw translation keys.
  - `customer-properties.pbt.spec.ts` expected null customer sort values to stay last, but the local test helper normalized null to an empty string that sorted first.

### Fix applied
- Added a `ConfigService` mock to `auth.controller.spec.ts`.
- Updated the `DocBreadcrumb` test translation mock to return `Yardım` for `help.nav.back`.
- Updated the local customer sort test helper so empty/null values sort last in both directions.

### Verification
- Backend must-pass regression set passed:
  - `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend test -- auth.controller.spec.ts tickets.controller.spec.ts notifications.gateway.spec.ts ai-query.service.spec.ts`
  - Result: 5 suites passed, 48 tests passed, 1 skipped.
- Frontend must-pass regression set passed:
  - `pnpm --filter @aluplan/frontend exec vitest run src/lib/api.spec.ts src/lib/permissions.spec.ts src/components/help/DocBreadcrumb.spec.tsx 'src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/customers/customer-properties.pbt.spec.ts'`
  - Result: 4 files passed, 58 tests passed.

### Note
- Use `pnpm --filter @aluplan/frontend exec vitest run <files...>` for targeted frontend checks. Avoid adding an extra `--` after `test:unit` because it can widen the run unexpectedly.

## Follow-up - 2026-05-13 Grounded Fallback + Hotinfo Signals

### Root cause
- Skipping sync LLM re-ranking fixed the quota stall, but fallback mode could still surface the wrong top document, e.g. an "Allplan running slow" FAQ for a Turkish graphics-card-driver update question.
- Turkish UI/questions could receive raw English source text because fallback used source content directly when Gemini was quota-limited.
- Hotinfo was available but not injected for Turkish phrases like "grafik kartı" and "sürüm güncelleme" because the hardware-query regex missed these variants.

### Fix applied
- Added query-aware local reranking for sync diagnosis fallback, with stronger signal coverage for graphics card, driver, update, IFC, license, and performance intents.
- Added deterministic fallback summaries:
  - Turkish locale now returns a Turkish safe summary plus the original source passage as a source excerpt.
  - Sync diagnosis generation timeout reduced to 6s so Gemini free-tier quota stalls degrade faster.
- Replaced duplicated hardware regex checks with normalized hardware/system-query detection that includes Turkish variants such as `grafik kartı`, `ekran kartı`, `sürüm`, and `güncelleme`.

### Verification
- `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend test -- ai-query.service.spec.ts` passed
- `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend typecheck` passed
- `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend build` passed
- Backend restarted successfully on `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`

## Follow-up - 2026-05-13 DevOps Standardization Checkpoints

### Goal
- Preserve the currently working RAG/ticket system while moving the project toward cleaner DevOps practice.
- Keep Qdrant out of scope; current direction remains pgvector + Gemini/LLMAPI.
- Split changes into small, reversible commits rather than mixing docs, product code, tests, and generated graph output.

### Completed checkpoints
- `54aaefe docs(memory): establish project memory system`
  - `.ai` now acts as project memory: bootstrap, current focus, ADRs, condensed handoff, retrieval policy, and session summary.
- `21b8956 test(regression): stabilize guard tests`
  - Stabilized backend auth/controller guard test setup and targeted frontend regression tests.
- `0f966a4 fix(ai): align embedding versioning and ingestion safeguards`
  - Removed stale `model_name` assumptions from embedding writes.
  - Added `ai_response_cache.embedding_dim` schema/migration alignment.
  - Moved observability distribution to `embedding_version + embedding_dim`.
  - Added Gemini 3072-dim registry/default handling and pgvector HNSW limit safeguards.
  - Added/updated targeted tests for embedding registry, Gemini defaults, RAG maintenance, PDF parsing, and ingestion safeguards.
- `b4d7d65 ci(config): enforce provider and migration validation`
  - Unified `validateEnv()` onto the shared Zod env schema.
  - Added Gemini/LLMAPI, low-rate ingestion, RAG thresholds, and observability env validation.
  - Added production `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` safety checks.
  - Replaced Prisma 7-incompatible CI migration diff with a blocking shadow-DB migration drift gate.
  - Added `LlmApiService` regression coverage for Gemini-compatible OpenAI endpoint defaults.
- `7485e6a chore(ops): harden rag sync observability`
  - Removed an Antigravity scratch-file debug write from knowledge pool sync.
  - Replaced a sync controller `console.log` with Nest logger debug.
  - Added RAG source health metrics: total, parsed, and failed knowledge sources.
  - Repaired `ai.controller.spec.ts` provider mocks exposed during targeted tests.

### Verification already run
- Backend RAG tests:
  - `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend test -- embedding.service.spec.ts embedding-version.registry.spec.ts rag-maintenance.service.spec.ts gemini.service.spec.ts ai-query.service.spec.ts`
- Backend config tests:
  - `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend test -- env-validation.spec.ts llm-api.service.spec.ts`
- Backend ops tests:
  - `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend test -- knowledge-pool-job.spec.ts ai.controller.spec.ts`
- Backend typecheck:
  - `pnpm --filter @aluplan/backend typecheck`
- Frontend typecheck:
  - `pnpm --filter @aluplan/frontend typecheck`
- Prisma validate:
  - `pnpm exec prisma validate --schema packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`

### Current working tree after these commits
- Still intentionally uncommitted / pending cleanup:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `CLAUDE.md`
  - `apps/backend/openapi.json`
  - `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
  - `.agents/skills/`
  - `.github/agents/`
  - `.kiro/specs/*`
- Do not mix these with product commits. Next phase should be AGENTS/tooling/docs cleanup.

### Tooling note
- Graphify hook ran after each commit, but warned that the rebuilt graph has ~5572 nodes while existing `graph.json` has 11474 nodes, so it refused to overwrite the existing graph JSON. `GRAPH_REPORT.md` changed and should be treated as graph-output cleanup, not product code.
- GitNexus `detect_changes` currently reports only dirty docs/tooling symbols because product code checkpoints are committed.

### Next recommended step
- Finish Faz 4:
  - Clean `AGENTS.md` into one concise instruction file with a single GitNexus block.
  - Keep `.agents`, `.kiro`, `.github/agents`, `CLAUDE.md`, OpenAPI, and Graphify output in separate docs/tooling commits or archive decisions.
  - Re-run `git status`, Graphify/GitNexus checks, and update this summary again.

## Follow-up - 2026-05-13 AGENTS Cleanup

### Root cause
- `AGENTS.md` had grown to 2279 lines because multiple AI-agent exports were pasted into the same file.
- It contained repeated AGENTS blocks, a Gemini/OpenCode chat transcript, n8n-as-code bootstrap text, imported Claude instructions, and duplicate GitNexus blocks.
- This made the primary startup instruction file noisy and risky for future agents.

### Fix applied
- Replaced `AGENTS.md` with a concise 215-line project instruction file.
- Kept the current repo map, command set, truth hierarchy, RAG/Gemini direction, high-blast-radius areas, i18n/testing notes, DevOps commit hygiene, Graphify rules, and exactly one GitNexus block.
- Removed embedded chat transcripts, duplicate AGENTS sections, n8n generated text, and imported Claude dump from `AGENTS.md`.

### Remaining docs/tooling state
- `CLAUDE.md` only has a GitNexus index-count refresh and can be committed with AGENTS cleanup.
- `apps/backend/openapi.json` is currently modified to empty by generated output; do not commit until regenerated or intentionally restored.
- `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` changed after commit hooks, but Graphify warned that rebuilt graph node count is much smaller than existing `graph.json`; do not commit graph output until that warning is resolved.
- `.agents/skills/`, `.github/agents/`, and new `.kiro/specs/*` remain untracked tooling/spec artifacts and should be reviewed in a separate commit/archive decision.
