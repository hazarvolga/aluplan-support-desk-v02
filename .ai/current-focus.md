# Current Focus

## Active Work

- Phase 1 RAG relevance/cache fix is committed. Continue with a measured RAG quality program, not ad-hoc browser questions.
- Use `.ai/rag-quality/acceptance-questions.json` as the active acceptance set before importing more files or changing retrieval logic.
- Faz 3 retrieval-only acceptance completed: 25 questions, 19 pass, 6 real quality/data failures, 0 remaining throttle-only failures.
- Faz 4 narrow retrieval fix committed: negated license intent and pilot/canonical preference target checks pass.
- Faz 5 source-gap decision is documented in `.ai/rag-quality/source-gap-plan-2026-05-15.md`.
- Batch 012 source-gap import completed for Allplan Share/Cloud and Project Data Management:
  - 4 PDFs registered from `dataset/**/batch-012`.
  - 4/4 sync logs ended as `SUCCESS`.
  - 179 embeddings written as `v2_2 / 3072`.
  - `rag-tr-share-cloud-001` and `rag-tr-project-backup-001` now pass retrieval acceptance.
- Hotinfo diagnostic flow is now treated as ticket-specific context, not global RAG corpus:
  - raw Hotinfo traces stay out of retrieval query to avoid source pollution.
  - safe Hotinfo system signals can enrich retrieval when the user explicitly asks for Hotinfo/system analysis.
  - prompt context includes richer Hotinfo fields for final diagnosis.
- Use `.ai/rag-quality/run-acceptance.mjs` for future localhost retrieval checks; default delay is intentionally throttle-safe.
- Pause the PDF-first import after the support-first seed corpus and validate real RAG quality before importing more files.
- Build the PDF-first RAG dataset import path without polluting the knowledge pool with generated MD duplicates.
- Keep `dataset/` as the clean import surface and `.archive/rag-incoming/pdf/` as the raw PDF inbox.
- Preserve Gemini/LLMAPI + pgvector and low-rate ingestion while importing in small validated batches.
- Ensure Knowledge Pool sources carry useful `metadata.category` values from both dataset scan and UI upload.
- Controlled 5-file PDF support batches 001 through 011 completed successfully.
- Keep title-specific retrieval boosting in place so near-duplicate FAQ topics rank by the most specific PDF title, not only vector similarity.
- Keep OpenAI as chat fallback only. Do not use OpenAI as embedding fallback while the active corpus is Gemini `3072/v2_2`.
- Ensure unchanged dataset files with zero embeddings are re-indexed or fail clearly; never mark them as successful with an empty vector set.

## Avoid Breaking

- `AiService` provider dispatch, retry, and fallback behavior.
- `AiQueryService` sync diagnosis and async query flows.
- `EmbeddingService` knowledge pool, ticket, and article embedding writes.
- `RagMaintenanceService` vector dimension and index maintenance behavior.
- `NotificationsGateway` and WebSocket connection flows.
- Ticket lifecycle and AI-optional ticket creation.

## Known Risks

- Gemini quota/rate limits can stall model-backed reranking or final answer generation if not bounded.
- Gemini 3072-dim embeddings affect pgvector column dimensions and HNSW index compatibility.
- Generated MD files from old PDF conversion flows can duplicate or distort canonical PDF sources.
- Legacy sources with `General` category can still appear after correctly categorized sources until old metadata is cleaned or reclassified.
- Similar multilingual FAQ topics can still tie at capped similarity `1.000`; inspect rank order and source metadata, not only displayed similarity.
- Mixing embedding providers in the same `embedding_version` can corrupt retrieval even when vector dimensions match; model-space compatibility matters as much as dimension.
- A source can have an unchanged content hash while still having zero embeddings from an earlier failed run; sync must verify embeddings before treating unchanged content as healthy.
- `graphify` CLI was previously unavailable in PATH, so graph updates may need environment repair.
- `apps/backend/openapi.json` is modified separately; do not mix it into RAG import commits unless intentionally regenerated.

## Next Recommended Step

Keep Hotinfo and AI-optional ticket creation separate from vendor PDF RAG:

- Hotinfo needs canonical PDF/TXT source approval before import, because current confirmed candidates are MD-only.
- AI-optional ticket creation should be app-help/product copy, not vendor FAQ retrieval.
- Next retrieval step: run the focused acceptance set after any new source import before changing retrieval code again.
- Next product-flow step: verify in the browser that a newly uploaded `.hxl` appears in AI diagnosis context and in the created ticket snapshot.
