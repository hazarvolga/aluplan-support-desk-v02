# Current Focus

## Active Work

- Build the PDF-first RAG dataset import path without polluting the knowledge pool with generated MD duplicates.
- Keep `dataset/` as the clean import surface and `.archive/rag-incoming/pdf/` as the raw PDF inbox.
- Preserve Gemini/LLMAPI + pgvector and low-rate ingestion while importing in small validated batches.
- Ensure Knowledge Pool sources carry useful `metadata.category` values from both dataset scan and UI upload.
- Continue controlled 5-file PDF support batches. Batch 001 and Batch 002 completed; Batch 003 is currently 4/5 synced because the final Gemini embedding attempt hit quota.
- Keep title-specific retrieval boosting in place so near-duplicate FAQ topics rank by the most specific PDF title, not only vector similarity.
- Keep OpenAI as chat fallback only. Do not use OpenAI as embedding fallback while the active corpus is Gemini `3072/v2_2`.
- Ensure unchanged dataset files with zero embeddings are re-indexed or fail clearly; never mark them as successful with an empty vector set.

## Avoid Breaking

- `AiService` provider dispatch, retry, and fallback behavior.
- `AiQueryService` sync diagnosis and async query flows.
- `EmbeddingService` knowledge pool, ticket, and article embedding writes.
- `RagMaintenanceService` vector dimension and index maintenance behavior.
- `NotificationsGateway` and WebSocket connection flows.
- Ticket lifecycle and AI-optional ticket creation.

## Known Risks

- Gemini quota/rate limits can stall model-backed reranking or final answer generation if not bounded.
- Gemini 3072-dim embeddings affect pgvector column dimensions and HNSW index compatibility.
- Generated MD files from old PDF conversion flows can duplicate or distort canonical PDF sources.
- Legacy sources with `General` category can still appear after correctly categorized sources until old metadata is cleaned or reclassified.
- Similar multilingual FAQ topics can still tie at capped similarity `1.000`; inspect rank order and source metadata, not only displayed similarity.
- Mixing embedding providers in the same `embedding_version` can corrupt retrieval even when vector dimensions match; model-space compatibility matters as much as dimension.
- A source can have an unchanged content hash while still having zero embeddings from an earlier failed run; sync must verify embeddings before treating unchanged content as healthy.
- `graphify` CLI was previously unavailable in PATH, so graph updates may need environment repair.
- `apps/backend/openapi.json` is modified separately; do not mix it into RAG import commits unless intentionally regenerated.

## Next Recommended Step

Retry the failed Batch 003 source only after Gemini embedding quota recovers. Do not enable OpenAI embedding fallback for the retry. After it succeeds, verify Batch 003 has 5/5 sources `SUCCESS`, embeddings only `3072/v2_2`, admin UI categories, and language-specific search. If quota is still exhausted, leave the source failed rather than polluting the pool.
