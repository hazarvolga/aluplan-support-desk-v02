# Current Focus

## Active Work

- Pause the PDF-first import after the support-first seed corpus and validate real RAG quality before importing more files.
- Build the PDF-first RAG dataset import path without polluting the knowledge pool with generated MD duplicates.
- Keep `dataset/` as the clean import surface and `.archive/rag-incoming/pdf/` as the raw PDF inbox.
- Preserve Gemini/LLMAPI + pgvector and low-rate ingestion while importing in small validated batches.
- Ensure Knowledge Pool sources carry useful `metadata.category` values from both dataset scan and UI upload.
- Controlled 5-file PDF support batches 001 through 011 completed successfully.
- Keep title-specific retrieval boosting in place so near-duplicate FAQ topics rank by the most specific PDF title, not only vector similarity.
- Keep OpenAI as chat fallback only. Do not use OpenAI as embedding fallback while the active corpus is Gemini `3072/v2_2`.
- Ensure unchanged dataset files with zero embeddings are re-indexed or fail clearly; never mark them as successful with an empty vector set.

## Avoid Breaking

- `AiService` provider dispatch, retry, and fallback behavior.
- `AiQueryService` sync diagnosis and async query flows.
- `EmbeddingService` knowledge pool, ticket, and article embedding writes.
- `RagMaintenanceService` vector dimension and index maintenance behavior.
- `NotificationsGateway` and WebSocket connection flows.
- Ticket lifecycle and AI-optional ticket creation.

## Known Risks

- Gemini quota/rate limits can stall model-backed reranking or final answer generation if not bounded.
- Gemini 3072-dim embeddings affect pgvector column dimensions and HNSW index compatibility.
- Generated MD files from old PDF conversion flows can duplicate or distort canonical PDF sources.
- Legacy sources with `General` category can still appear after correctly categorized sources until old metadata is cleaned or reclassified.
- Similar multilingual FAQ topics can still tie at capped similarity `1.000`; inspect rank order and source metadata, not only displayed similarity.
- Mixing embedding providers in the same `embedding_version` can corrupt retrieval even when vector dimensions match; model-space compatibility matters as much as dimension.
- A source can have an unchanged content hash while still having zero embeddings from an earlier failed run; sync must verify embeddings before treating unchanged content as healthy.
- `graphify` CLI was previously unavailable in PATH, so graph updates may need environment repair.
- `apps/backend/openapi.json` is modified separately; do not mix it into RAG import commits unless intentionally regenerated.

## Next Recommended Step

Do not continue bulk import blindly. First run a real RAG acceptance test with 20-30 customer-like questions across Turkish, English, and German. Measure whether the top source is correct, the answer language follows locale/query intent, legacy `General` sources do not outrank categorized PDF sources, and multilingual near-duplicate ties do not degrade the answer. After that, resume selective imports with Batch 012 only for gaps revealed by the test set.
